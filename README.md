👋 Hi! I'm Charles Carrasco, a recent graduate with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from California State University, Long Beach. I'm really interested in working in software development, IT, and cybersecurity, and I'm excited to connect with people who share similar interests.

💻 I have experience working with JavaScript, TypeScript, and frameworks like Next.js and React to build websites, blogs, and custom CRMs. I’ve also done server management, including Linux, cloud platforms, and setting up secure systems.

✨ Over the past few years, I’ve been freelancing, helping clients with everything from web design to server maintenance, DNS configurations, and even managing email systems. I’ve learned a lot about managing projects, working with clients, and making sure things run smoothly and efficiently.

🚀 Lately, I’ve been contracting for a technology company and have also worked on projects like Re-sume.com and Brainstache.com, which have helped me improve my development skills and gain real-world experience. These projects have involved both front-end and back-end work, security setups, and managing everything from start to finish.

🌐 I’m actively looking for a position where I can use my skills and really enjoy the work I do. If you're looking to collaborate or have opportunities in software, IT, or cybersecurity, I'd love to chat and see how we can work together!
